# PROJECTS

**RASC-AL Lunar Rover Project Proposal**Spring 2024

2em0pt Our six person team submitted a proposal to the NASA RASC-AL
competition for a lunar rover designed for crater exploration and
regolith characterization. I performed analytical calculations of energy
consumption and the mechanics of screw driven motion through lunar
regolith, dark, and other harsh conditions, reported on materials for
our use case and used optical microscopy to characterize regolith
simulants for a proof of concept experiment.

**Hybrid Scooter & Electric Stroller Design**Fall 2022

2em0pt For the intro to engineering graphics final project, our team of
five collaborated to design components for an electric scooter and
stroller hybrid. I produced contour sketches and GD&T multiview sketches
for 10 parts out of a 50 part assembly, modeled those parts, mated the
final assembly, created exploded views and animated the model for our
team presentation.
